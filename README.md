## Intro
`Go Plugin over gRPC` is a lightweight `Golang` two-way communication plugin framework with built-in health check, plugin management, logging and other extensions.

The framework is lightweight and very easy to use, you only need to spend a little time to migrate the existing plugin implementation, or build your own plugin system from scratch.
